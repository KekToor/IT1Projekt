                        Weapons are the basic tools to deal damage in Dark Souls 3. Players may equip up to
                        <strong>3</strong> in the slots for each hand. When developing a build, the player should try to
                        find the weapon that mixes the right amount of <strong>damage, bonuses and moveset</strong>,
                        alongside <strong>stamina consumption and Skills.</strong>

                    &emsp;Daggers are lightweight, small, and have fast attack speed. Their main positive is their
                    Critical damage,
                    which allows them to inflict incredible damage on backstabs and ripostes. Daggers do have
                    problems that set them back; Daggers have very short-range, often requiring the user to get up
                    close to the opponent to inflict damage; they also lack the ability to trade with heavier
                    weapons like Greatswords, Ultra Greathammers, and Ultra Greatswords due to their low poise
                    damage and damage without buffs.

                    choice for beginners, as well as more experienced players, considering its speed, reach and damage;
                    they are useful both in the usual PvE mode, as well as PvP, using so called "R1 Spam", which equals
                    to spamming the light attack in order to beat your opponent.

                    from Stomp to Stance to unique Skills. In terms of damage output per stamina expended, Greatswords
                    are easily the best value weapon category, making them really useful in PvE, however, other weapon
                    classes outperform Greatswords in PvP.

                    Strength requirements. They benefit from "hyper armor" during certain attack animations, allowing
                    you to continue a combo even while being struck. They also cannot be parried when two-handed, with
                    the exception of the rolling and running attacks. There are 2 types of Ultra Greatswords; Horizontal
                    Ultra Greatswords, which are good for hitting multiple opponents due to its wide range, while with
                    Vertical Ultra Greatswords, normal attacks turn into vertical slams once they are 2-handed and have
                    the ability to hit behind the user when the second normal attack is used.

                    &emsp;Curved Swords are a generally a Dexterity-based weapon class with fast swing speeds, decent
                    damage
                    and range, and a excellent roll-catching abilities. However, there are some negatives to Curved
                    Swords; players with high Poise and heavier weapons like Greatswords, Ultra Greatswords, and Great
                    Hammers players will be able to tank-out hits/parry these players easily. Curver Swords attract
                    beginners due to their positives, and are widely used in both PvE and PvP modes.

                    running attacks. Like curved swords, they utilize primarily on slashing attacks. While useful in
                    many scenarios, such as PvP, their main downfall is their low durability, and therefore u should be
                    careful when using them in PvE mode.

                    they also possess Auxiliary effects such as Bleeding or Poison. Like katanas, they also have a lower

                    quickly, have good reach, and are capable of punishing counter-attacks rather well. Most of them can
                    also attack froh behind a shield. Thrusting Swords replace the kick with a quick retreating attack
                    that does minor damage.

                    the Skill Warcry, which provides the weapon with a damage boost for 30 seconds. They are generally
                    considered worse than straight swords, due to their lower attack speed, weaker damage output, and
                    having an arguably worse moveset and Skill spread. However, they provide you with higher damage, and

                    Claws are often used as parrying tools, due to their fast parry frames. Fist weapons have a faster

                    These weapons require patience and careful spacing to make proper use of, but are capable of

                    &emsp;Halberds usually do moderate damage and have long reach. Halberds are generally either a
                    fusion
                    between a spear and another weapon, thus combining straight thrusting attacks and wide swinging
                    strikes, or are simply a cutting or chopping weapon on a long shaft, which is swung across and
                    overhead at a distance. These weapons often have trouble performing in close range or tight
                    quarters.

                    &emsp;Reapers have long reach and a unique sweeping moveset, and most are Bleed weapons. These
                    weapons are
                    particularly useful for sneaking damage behind shields, when swung with proper spacing.

                    Reapers have a "sweet spot" in which they will do bonus damage when swung at the precise range that
                    their blade reaches the target, and will perform less powerfully when struck with the shaft of the
                    weapon if you are too close to the target. Reapers will also deal chip damage through shields if the
                    "sweet spot" lands, even if the shield has a 100% physical block.

                    &emsp;Whips usually do little to moderate damage, and perform poorly against well-armored foes, but
                    have long reach and can have Auxiliary effects such as Bleeding or Poison. Unlike other melee
                    weapons, whips cannot be parried but cannot backstab or riposte.

                    &emsp;Bows have changed a bit in Dark Souls 3. Different Bow types have different attack speeds,
                    ranges and damage. They require arrows and usually a decent amount of Dexterity. It will be possible
                    to use a Short Bow in melee range. Bows can not be infused.

                    &emsp;Greatbows are extremely powerful version of Bows that can knock enemies off their feet in a
                    single shot, in exchange for how demanding they are to use. Operating these weapons demand the
                    operator stop moving entirely, and drawing a greatbow is a time consuming process that leaves the
                    user vulnerable.

                    &emsp;These Weapons usually do moderate damage and have less range than Bows. They are generally
                    more close ranged weapons, allowing players to "shoot from the hip" and reload on the move without
                    entering a two-handed stance. These weapons do not scale with stats, and as a result are less useful
                    on consecutive NG+ runs. Crossbows use Bolts.

                    disliked options in PvP, due to the fact that they're simple to use and generally require little to
                    no skills.

                    Pyromancies. The base game has only one Flame, with the Ashes of Ariandel DLC adding a second one
                    and The Ringed City DLC adding a Curved Sword (Demon's Scar) that doubles as a Pyromance Flame.

                    them from Chimes and turns them towards PvP use. Not meeting the Faith requirement for the Talisman
                    will drop the spell buff to a flat 60.
